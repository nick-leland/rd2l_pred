,,DoomCow33,https://www.dotabuff.com/players/172199571,5841,5,5,5,5,5,Man i can't believe how anti-value this DoomCow guys is. Why do we keep letting an obvious account buyer signup for this league every 4 months? Like seriously what the fuck is wrong with admins. Do they unironically think this braindead idiot could hit immortal without paying for boosting? Another signup another season the admins continue to let the league rot. Please don't let him captain and extra gief four other players.

,,amateur chef,https://www.dotabuff.com/players/76424090,3299,2,2,5,3,2,"I'm Bryson. My talents include:
- competent laning
- not verbally abusing my teammates
- not giving up/checking out until the glowing building explodes

I'm most comfortable as an offlaner, but slap me into whatever role and I'll try my balls off.
I've got a few strange picks/builds that I'm extremely confident in, though I can be talked into more conventional decisions as well.
My schedule is relatively flexible/open, though I can't really commit to extremely long practice grinds either."
