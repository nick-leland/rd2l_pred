Each fiber of pleasure you experience causes equivalent pain somewhere else. This is the first law of emodynamics. Joy can be neither created nor destroyed. The balance of happiness is constant. Fact: Every time you eat a bite of cake, someone gets horsewhipped. Facter: Every time two people kiss, an orphanage collapses. Factest: Every time a baby is born, an innocent animal is severely mocked for its physical appearance."

Haven't played too much of this patch due to weddings, but I feel like I can still contribute well as long as the team is communicative and have a solid shotcaller. Down to clown or play to win, I guess it depends on the rest of the team dynamics. Past couple of seasons I've been on teams that have been pretty much MIA until gameday which is fine, but it would also be nice to have a team that likes to practice or scrim to get better chemistry."
