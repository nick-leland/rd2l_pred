No drama please. Looking to play some try-hard dota. Pick me as support and I'll win the lane for you.
I like to talk a lot during the laning phase and will do my best to communicate into the mid game. 
I never flame or rage, and I expect the same from my teammates.

Previously, I've qualified for Round 1 playoffs in Season 24 with PonyPals.
